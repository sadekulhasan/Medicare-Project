            <h3>Delivery Information</h3>
            <p>At Medicare, we strive to ensure that every product and service reaches our users promptly and safely. Below is a detailed breakdown of our delivery procedures and policies:</p>

            <h4>1. Medicine Delivery</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Order Processing:</strong> Orders are processed within 24 hours after submission, provided a valid prescription (if required) has been uploaded and verified. We aim to minimize delays and ensure all medicines are verified for authenticity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Estimated Delivery Time:</strong> Delivery times are dependent on your location:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Urban Areas:</strong> Expect deliveries within 1-3 business days, ensuring fast access to essential medicines.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rural Areas:</strong> Delivery to remote locations may take between 3-7 business days. We are continuously working on reducing these times through strategic partnerships.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tracking Orders:</strong> Users can track their orders in real-time using our app or website. Notifications are sent at each stage, from order confirmation to delivery.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Delivery Charges:</strong> Standard delivery fees apply to all orders. Free delivery may be available for orders exceeding a specified amount or during promotional periods.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote class="note">Note: During peak times or unforeseen events such as natural disasters, delivery times may be extended. We appreciate your patience and understanding.</blockquote>

                    Upon request, the nearest available ambulance is dispatched immediately, minimizing response time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users can track the ambulances real-time location, estimated time of arrival, and contact the driver directly for updates.
